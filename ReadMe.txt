1. To use the LocalisationGenerator, put it in the same directory as the file you want to generate localisation for
2. Then input the filename WITHOUT the file extension
3. Then choose a name for the localisation file, and move that over to the localisation folder
DO NOT use this to update a loc file with data already in it, this is purely a tool for generating the file :)
