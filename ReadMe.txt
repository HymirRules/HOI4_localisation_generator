To use the LocalisationGenerator, put it in the same directory as the file you want to generate localisation for
then input the filename WITHOUT the file extension
then choose a name for the localisation file, and move that over to the localisation folder
DO NOT use this to update a loc file with data already in it, this is purely a tool for generating the file :)
